            <p>An idea can blossom into something that can bring unspeakable joy or misery to millions. Every human endeavour no matter how small or great began with a simple idea. This philosophy is at the heart of TED whose mission is to spread ‘ideas worth spreading’ to the masses.</p>
            <br />
            <p>TED is a media organization devoted to spreading ideas. Owing to its Silicon Valley origins TED's early emphasis was on technology, entertainment and design,but it has since broadened its focus to include talks on many scientific, cultural, humanitarian and academic topics. Each Ted talk is given by an expert in their particular field. Past speakers include  Bill Clinton,  Al Gore, Gordon Brown, David Cameron, Billy Graham, Richard Dawkins, Bill Gates, Bono, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and many Nobel Prize winners.</p>

            <img src="dist/imgs/tedxinfo.png">
            <p>TEDx is a group of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. These events are hyperlocal and take up issues that are relevant to the hosting community and are free from corporate, religious and political agenda. Each event is branded as a TEDx, where the x = independently organized TED event. At every TEDx event, TEDTalks videos and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and meaningful connections within the audience. Every TEDx conference remains true to the core philosophy of TED and celebrates Ideas worth spreading.</p>
